# Project

Project Description

<!--Pull individual Views IDLY into the "In Progress" and break down the stuff in parens into individual list items when working on them-->
<!-- Testing tutorial https://www.albertgao.xyz/2017/05/24/how-to-test-expressjs-with-jest-and-supertest/ -->
<!-- Prisma has a jest mock https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing -->

### Todo

- Add plugins to markdown-it
- Add Passport & Discord Oauth
- Add input verification to settings pages
- Prep Procfile and ENV for Piku needs
- Setup Prisma to actually use mysql instead
- BUG > Title and Name can be blank because '' is a proper string. Normalize data with a middleware?
- Add styling to update and error reporting

### Views I don't like yet

- Welcome Page needs to explain the concept of what Rough Drafts is and look more presentable
- List of Articles (Needs link to User Settings, search functions, and filtering. Like tags & published status.)
- New User Page (Should explain the formatting and have better nav)
- Raw Page (Don't know how it actually feels to access)

### Done ✓

- Article Settings (Needs to handle published mode, title, summary, and imply rbac stuff. Also needs ability to delete article. Might need ability to transfer article ownership?)
- Swap to Server JS
- Organize functions and files
- See if theres a view thats just template literals
- Find a testing suite (Jest?)
- Prepare functions for unit testing
- Edit Page (Needs to know if the user is logged in or not)
- User Settings (Needs to handle changing display name and vanity settings and allow downloading notes)
- BUG Editing need hidden for title or something.
- Add update and error reporting to settings pages
